## Appendix: Testing Calculator

### ROI Calculator for Optimizations
```javascript
function calculateOptimizationROI(current, improved, traffic, value) {
  const currentRevenue = traffic * (current/100) * value;
  const improvedRevenue = traffic * (improved/100) * value;
  const lift = improvedRevenue - currentRevenue;

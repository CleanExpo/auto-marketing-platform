# MCP and Google TTD RD Integration Guide

## Overview

This Auto Marketing platform now integrates:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** with Sequential Thinking for intelligent content generation
- **Google TTD RD (Test-Driven Development with Rapid Deployment)** for reliable feature development

## Architecture

### MCP Integration (`src/services/mcp-integration.ts`)
- Sequential thinking provider for step-by-step problem solving
- Context-aware content generation
- Multi-provider support architecture

### TTD RD Framework (`src/services/ttd-rd-framework.ts`)
- Test-first development workflow
- Automated testing pipeline
- Rapid deployment with auto-rollback
- Health check monitoring

### Marketing Workflow (`src/services/marketing-mcp-workflow.ts`)
- Platform-specific content generation
- Automated optimization pipeline
- Multi-platform campaign management

## API Endpoints

### MCP Endpoints
- `POST /api/mcp-ttd/mcp/sequential-think` - Execute sequential thinking
- `GET /api/mcp-ttd/mcp/status` - Check MCP status

### TTD RD Endpoints
- `POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/create-tests` - Create test-first development tests
- `POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/implement-feature` - Implement feature with tests
- `POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/rapid-deploy` - Deploy with auto-rollback
- `POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/integrate-mcp` - Integrate feature with MCP

## Usage Examples

### 1. Sequential Thinking for Content Generation
```javascript
POST /api/mcp-ttd/mcp/sequential-think
{
  "problem": "Create engaging Twitter content for product launch",
  "steps": [
    "Analyze target audience",
    "Research trending hashtags",
    "Create hook statement",
    "Write main content",
    "Add call-to-action"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Test-Driven Feature Development
```javascript
POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/create-tests
{
  "featureName": "engagement-tracker",
  "testCases": [
    {
      "id": "test1",
      "description": "Should track likes correctly",
      "input": { "likes": 100 },
      "expectedOutput": { "engagement": "high" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Rapid Deployment
```javascript
POST /api/mcp-ttd/ttd/rapid-deploy
{
  "environment": "staging",
  "autoRollback": true,
  "healthCheckUrl": "/health",
  "maxDeployTime": 60000
}
```

## TTD RD Workflow

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Define test cases before implementation
   - Specify expected inputs and outputs
   - Create comprehensive test coverage

2. **Implement Feature**
   - Write code to pass tests
   - Use MCP for intelligent code generation
   - Validate against test suite

3. **Rapid Deploy**
   - Run automated tests
   - Deploy to environment
   - Monitor health checks
   - Auto-rollback on failure

## Configuration

The system uses `mcp.config.json` for configuration:
- MCP server definitions
- TTD RD deployment settings
- Workflow configurations

## NPM Scripts

- `npm run mcp:init` - Initialize MCP inspector
- `npm run test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run deploy:dev` - Deploy to development
- `npm run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging
- `npm run deploy:prod` - Deploy to production
- `npm run rollback` - Rollback deployment

## Benefits

### MCP Sequential Thinking
- Step-by-step problem decomposition
- Context-aware decision making
- Improved content quality
- Systematic approach to complex tasks

### Google TTD RD
- Higher code reliability
- Faster deployment cycles
- Automatic rollback protection
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Reduced production issues

## Best Practices

1. **Always write tests first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Use sequential thinking** - Break complex problems into steps
3. **Monitor deployments** - Watch health checks and metrics
4. **Leverage auto-rollback** - Enable for production deployments
5. **Integrate workflows** - Combine MCP and TTD for maximum benefit

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Issues
- Check if MCP servers are running: `npm run mcp:init`
- Verify configuration in `mcp.config.json`
- Check logs for initialization errors

### TTD RD Issues
- Ensure tests are passing: `npm test`
- Verify deployment scripts exist
- Check health check endpoints
- Review rollback logs if deployment fails

## Future Enhancements

- Additional MCP providers (memory, web search, etc.)
- Advanced TTD metrics and reporting
- Multi-region deployment support
- Enhanced A/B testing integration
- Real-time performance monitoring
